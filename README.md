# Heat Transfer Simulation and Derivation in Fortran

This repository contains Fortran implementations for simulating heat transfer on a 2D metal plate and calculating derivatives. Visualization of the results is done using MATLAB.

## Heat Transfer Simulation

The Fortran code simulates heat transfer on a 2D metal plate, illustrating how heat propagates over time. The simulation results have been captured and are visualized in the GIF below:

## Derivative Calculation

The Fortran code also includes a derivative calculation. Below is a graph showing a sinusoidal function and its calculated derivative, which resembles the cosine function:
